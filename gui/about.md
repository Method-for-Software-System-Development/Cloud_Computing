# About the CIM & Robotics Laboratory

The CIM & Robotics Laboratory at Braude College of Engineering, established in 1997, serves as an advanced learning environment for students in Industrial and Mechanical Engineering. Located in Room D106, the lab includes semi-industrial CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing) and FMS (Flexible Manufacturing System) platforms.

The facility offers hands-on experience with:
- Robotic arms and assembly systems
- CNC machining and simulation
- CAD/CAM tools
- Vision-based quality control
- Programmable logic controllers (PLCs)
- Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS)

Students engage in real-world manufacturing scenarios that bridge theoretical knowledge with industry-relevant skills.

# About the Application

The **OptiLine Dashboard** is a cloud-based interface designed for engineers working with the autonomous production line in the CIM lab. It provides:

- Real-time sensor monitoring from indoor and outdoor environments  
- Historical data analysis with trend visualization  
- Search capabilities over MQTT-related technical content  
- A fault simulator with daily challenges for diagnosing simulated malfunctions  
- A gamified experience with scoring based on performance and efficiency  
- A user directory and personalized dashboard view  

The system is accessible from any device with a secure login and supports both live and simulated data modes.
